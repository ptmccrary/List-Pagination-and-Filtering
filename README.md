# List Pagination and Filtering

The page contains a list of 54 student names, photos and email addresses. It displays 10 names at a time, and adds a navigation system (a series of links at the bottom of the page) to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time.

The page still displays the students' names without JavaScript turned on, but will be much improved with the JavaScript programming added.

The pagination solution works with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied list of 54 students.

## Usage

- You can navigate through the list of students using the nav buttons at the button of the page.

- You can also search for a specific student using the search bar, updating the list in real time as you type.
